## Freezly Privacy Policy

Freezly doesn't ask for or collect any personal information. The only data that will be stored online by the app is the items you enter into your lists, and the name of your groups. If you have an anonymous account, your data is linked to you by an anonymous user ID that is created when you first open the app. If you are signed into your Google account I can see your email address, but there are no mailing lists and I almost certainly will never email you. There are some anonymous analytics in the app too. The app contains no advertising, and doesn't track you or your usage for advertising purposes. You can share your data in the app with your friends by passing them your group name and key, and your data is not shared in any other way or with any other third parties.

If you don't want your entries stored anymore delete them from the app, and they will be gone forever. Once you've deleted something there's no backup, so it's gone. If your group is shared with another person, it will be deleted for them also. I hate unnecessary data collection and tracking so you can be damn sure I won't do it to you.
